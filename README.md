This repository is the collection of the instruction that allow developers to create CSGO Server in the any IaSS

##Intro
Recent past during the COVID-19 lockdown, few of my colleagues and I start to pay CSGO online during our free time to keep the camaraderie spirit! Initially, people with zero experience with CSGO start to lose most of the games, and eventually when the turn into pro, we identified that probability of the host winning high due to network delays. Especially non-host players will get headshot before even they cross the line as Host player can see you as most of the computation happen in the Host player.


I felt this is unfair for everyone and started to look into other options on how to host or rent the community servers. As a result, I lots of instruction on the CSGO community forum on how to install the Steam Server that can host the CSGO in IaSS.

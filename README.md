This repository is the collection of the instruction that allow developers to create CS:GO Server in the any IaSS

## Intro
Recent past during the COVID-19 lockdown, few of my colleagues and I started to play CSGO online during our free time to keep the camaraderie spirit! Initially, people with zero experience at CS:GO started to lose most of the games. Eventually when they turn into pro, we identified that probability of the host winning high due to network delays. Especially non-host players will get headshot even before they cross the line as Host player can see you as most of the computation happen in the Host player.


I felt this is unfair for everyone and started to look into other options on how to host or rent the community servers. As a result, I found lot of instructions on the CS:GO community forum on how to install the Steam Server that can host the CS:GO in IaSS.

This instruction repository mainly instruct how to set up the CS:GO Host server in major IaSS providers.


## Comman Tools and Accounts
I will be mainly utilizing the *open ssh* to connect to the Virtual Machines that I will be obtain to run these CSGO Servers. Further I do have a professional account (Only $5, when I registered :D) for Steam to obtain the Lience for running the CSGO game
